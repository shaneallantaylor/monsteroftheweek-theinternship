Things that happened:
* Three orbs apear in a field outside of town and the word "Choose" can be heard.
* To investigate Calen and Joy go to the comic shop.  Apparently run by monster experts.
* Rick attempts to confrunt Serpico with all the information gathered thus far.
* Neil gets drunk at Moonshadows.
* Amelia meets with Neil.
* The comic book guys take Joy and Calen to the field with the orbs.  Joy touches the center orb.
* The town and all the gang get sucked into a Pokemon game.
* People have certain abilities based on the pokemon character they are playing, and everyone has a pokemon.  They explore a nearby forest and find items to evolve their pokemon and themselves.
* They make their way to the gym where they face several challenges and fight a monster that shapeshifts between several pokemon forms and a trainer boy form.
* The monster is defeated and everyone returns to where they were before it started.
* Joy retains her evolved abilities (+1 on charm rolls)
* Amelia retains her red hair and guaranteed acrobatics.
* The gang is in [forget her name's] office.  She asks for any facts they have obtained.  Serpico comes in. Neil is still drunk and tries to get him to admit what kind of magical creature he is by confessing that he is himself a demon.  Serpico stabs and kills Neil.  The rest of the gang fights Serpico but he is too strong.  They give up fighting and he seems to indicate he is on their side and only killed Neil because he was a demon.  He takes them to a secret vault in his office.  Amelia tells the gang she was aware Neil was a demon and he may have jumped bodies.
* Neil successfully jumps into the boy mayor of Ithaca's body Joe S.  The team is not aware of this.
